👋 Hi, I’m Darsh.
🛠️ I believe business teams should operate like engineering teams - move fast (and not break things :P), build scalable systems, and make data the default.

⚡ My world these days is mostly Strategic Finance at Epic Games - helping monetize Unreal Engine and Fab (3D Asset Marketplace) better, while also laying the commercial foundation for Fab Create (Fab's text-to-3D product) . Before that, I helped steer India’s largest short-video app, ShareChat, towards a $1B a year ad business from zero as its first Strategic Finace hire. 

Fast-scaling companies need strategy & finance to unlock product decisions, not slow them down. I design business systems that let product and leadership teams move at lightning speed thorugh close collaboration - reliably answering “Should we build this?” or “Which customer actually makes us money?” should not weeks or months. When business runs at engineering velocity, you get fewer wrong bets, faster iteration, and more confidence to ship. OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma - all ahead-of-the-curve players established Strategy & Finance teams early on.  

💬 If you’re scaling and need operating leverage without the overhead - let’s talk.
