- 👋 Hi, I’m Darsh! 
- 🛠️ I beleive business teams should operate with an engineering mindset — prioritize fast, scalable, data-driven work
- ⚡ Currently: Strategic finance at Epic Games.
- ⚡ Before: augmented India's largest short-video platform towards building a $1Bn a year advertising business from scratch 
- 🔗 Fast-scaling companies need strategy & finance to unlock product decisions, not slow them down. _Should we build this feature?_ _Which customer segment actually makes money? Can we afford this roadmap?_ I build systems that answer those questions in hours, not weeks.
- 🎯 Business and commercial sophistication to lead complex unit economics, while technical enough to debate API design with engineering. End state: fulfilling collaboration, fewer wrong bets, more velocity.
- 📊 I automate relentlessly. Your product team doesn't wait three days for a scenario. When business moves at product speed, your team ships with confidence instead of speculation. OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma - all players who matter established Strategy & Finance teams early on. 
- 💬 If you're scaling and need operating leverage without the overhead, let's talk.
